# Scaled Up Web Infrastructure

![Image of a scaled up web infrastructure](3-scale_up.jpg)

This web infrastructure is a scaled up version of the infrastructure described [here](2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure.md). In this version, all SPOFs have been removed and each of the major components (web server, application server, and database servers) have been moved to separate GNU/Linux servers. The SSL protection isn't terminated at the load-balancer and each server's network is protected with a firewall and they're also monitored.
